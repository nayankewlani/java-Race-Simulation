Java Vehicle Race Simulation

This project simulates a race between multiple vehicles using Java and Object-Oriented Programming.

Features
- Multiple vehicles with different acceleration and top speeds
- Random acceleration for realistic behavior
- Time-based race simulation
- Winner detection based on race distance

How It Works
- Each vehicle updates speed and position every second
- The race continues until a vehicle crosses the target distance
- The winner and total time are displayed
